### TeX and MD Notes

* TeX & MD files for [PDF notes](https://github.com/mbr-phys/PDF-Notes)

	- personal sty files in [LaTeX Templates repo](https://github.com/mbr-phys/LaTeX-Templates)

	- images needed for docs located in folders beside them

	- second year using markdown format as well, using [markdown-preview-enhanced](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-preview-enhanced) for LaTeX maths viewing in atom and [pandoc](https://pandoc.org) for conversion to pdf
	
	- third year notes mainly back to tex for extra formatting, but lectures a bit useless, so less thorough note-taking there
	
	- fourth year notes started, will actually try to attend these for the notes this year
