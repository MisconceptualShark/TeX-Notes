## Lecture 11

### magnetic properties of free electrons

* Free electron model can predict magnetic properties
* how does metal respond when placed in magnetic field?

#### magnetic susceptibility of metals

* metals develop an induced magnetic moment in magnetic fields
* interactions between B-feild and electron spin
* it is known all materials show a weak paramagnetism which is independent of temperature
