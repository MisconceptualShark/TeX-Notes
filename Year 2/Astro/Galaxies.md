# Galaxies

## Lecture 1

### Observable Properties of Galaxies

* Luminosity
* Colour
* Extent - related to size on the sky
* Flux - related to luminosity
* Surface Brightness -
$$
    SB = \frac{dL}{dS} = 4\pi\frac{dF}{d\Omega}
$$
_$dF$ is change in flux, and $d\Omega$ is angle on the sky_

## Lecture 2

### Elliptical and Spiral Galaxies

* Elliptical Properties
    * Shape - Spheroidal
    * Colour - Red
    * Stars - Old (red giants, colder burning, long lifetime)
    * Interstellar Medium - No cold gas or dust
    * Dynamics - Random
    * Environment - Dense (lots of galaxies around)

* Spiral Properties
    * Shape - Disc
    * Colour - Blue
    * Stars - Old and young stars (blue giants, hot burning, short lifetimes, always new stars forming to replace old ones)
    * Interstellar Medium - Cold gas and dust
    * Dynamics - Stays on circular orbits
    * Environment - Not dense (not many galaxies around)

## Lecture 3

* Note $\sigma =$ dust
* Hence we can determine how much flux makes it through the ISM

$$
    \begin{aligned}
    \frac{dF}{F} &= -\frac{N\sigma}{S} = -\frac{m\cancel{S}dl\sigma}{\cancel{S}} = -m\sigma dl
    \frac{dF}{F} &= -m\sigma dl \implies F \propto e^{-m\sigma l}
    \end{aligned}
$$

* Note: this is in addition to the decrease in flux measured due to distance
* Red light gets absorbed less than blue light 
* $\theta = \frac{\lambda}{D}$ (angular distance you can distinguish with multiple telescopes)
* IR - radius : rotational-vibrational spectroscopy is a brand of molecular spectroscopy concerned with infrared and Raman spectrum
* Dust
* Synchotron radiation
* Gaia mission - mapping the milky way
* $\approx 30\%$ of light and therefore also mass in the bulge of the Milky Way
* A halo around a galaxy has a very small density of stars
    * this is often too faint to see

## Revision Lecture

### Important Points

- Dark matter:
    - evidence of dark matter in each of the following
    - Milky Way, other galaxies, clusters of galaxies
- Galaxy properties:
    - spiral
    - elliptical
    - irregular
    - stars and gas and other constituents
