\section{Introduction to lasers}
Lasers - coherence $\to$ 2 types - longitudinal and transverse
\begin{itemize}
    \item Lasers are highly coherent, both transversely and longitudinally. 
        Longitudinal and temporal coherence is related to linewidth, and will be discussed. 
        Coherence length $l_c$ and coherence time $\tau_c$ are the distance and time over which a coherent wave maintains a specified degree of coherence, i.e. when its phase is predictable. 
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Einstein's rate equations}
A laser requirs amplification due to stimulated emission of radiation. 
\textit{Doodle of two energy levels with E,g,N 1 and 2.}
\begin{align}
    E_2 - E_1 = \hbar\om_{12}
\end{align}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Spontaneous emission: Atom in some excited state, until some time later where it spontaneously decays into a lower state, with a photon emitted with energy shown in Eq (2.1). 
        Rates: $A_{21}$ per $N_i$ atoms, or $A_{21}N_2$ per $m^3$.
    \item Absorption: Excite into excited state using energy of photon. 
        Rates: $B_{12}\rho(\om_{12})$, $B_{12}\rho(\om_{12})N_2$.
    \item Stimulated emission: At the initial time we have an atom in an excited state which we then apply a radiated field (photon) to. Later, the atom will decay into a lower state and there will be two outgoing photons - they have been emitted into the same mode.
        Rates: $B_{21}\rho(\om_{12})$, $B_{21}\rho(\om_{12})N_2$. Note: 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Here, $\rho(\om_{12})$ is the spectral energy density - the energy density, per unit angular frequency range at $\om$, with units of $J\,m^{-3}\,s$.
            \item Generally, the light being used here is broad-band.
        \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Apply the 3 processess}
\textit{Doodle going through $A_{21}$ to $B_{12}$ to $B_{21}$.}
Conservation of atom number:
\begin{align}
    \frac{dN_2}{dt} &= -\frac{dN_1}{dt} \\
    N_1 + N_2 &= N = \text{const} \\
    N_1B_{12}\rho(\om_{12}) &= N_2A_{21} + N_2B_{21}\rho(\om_{12})
\end{align}
Rearrange for the spectral energy density:
\begin{align}
    \rho(\om_{12}) &= \frac{N_2A_{21}}{N_1B_{12}-N_2B_{21}} = \frac{\frac{A_{21}}{B_{21}}}{\frac{N_1}{N_2}\frac{B_{12}}{B_{21}} - 1}
\end{align}
Substitute using Boltzmann Law:
\begin{align}
    \frac{N_2}{N_1} &= \frac{g_2}{g_1}\exp\left(-\frac{\hbar\om_{12}}{k_BT}\right) \\
    \implies \rho(\om_{12}) &= \frac{\frac{A_{21}}{B_{21}}}{\frac{g_1}{g_2}\frac{B_{12}}{B_{21}}\exp\left(\frac{\hbar\om_{12}}{k_BT}\right) - 1}
\end{align}
Now look at Planck's Law:
\begin{align}
    \rho(\om) &= \frac{\hbar\om^3}{\pi^2c^3} \frac{1}{\exp\left(\frac{\hbar\om}{k_BT}\right) - 1}
\end{align}
Einstein realised there must be an extra condition to switch between these two forms.
This reveals:
\begin{align}
    g_1B_{12} &= g_2B_{21} \\
    A_{21} &= \frac{\hbar\om_{12}^3}{\pi^2c^3}B_{21}
\end{align}
Notes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Effectively only 1 coefficient as if we know A, we know B. 
    \item $A_{21}$ is the radiative decay rate,
        \begin{equation}
            A_{21} = \frac{1}{\tau_2}
        \end{equation}
    \item B has units $m^3\,J^{-1}\,s^{-2}$.
    \item A and B are constants for a particular atom.
    \item From the $\om^3$ term, we can see that an infrared transition may decay very fast, but a microwave transition may decay very slow. 
    \item Ratio of $A/B \propto \om^3$ - lasers at high requency harder to achieve.
    \item The principle of detailed balance states that \textbf{\unl{in equilibrium}, the total number of particles entering a quantum state by a partucular rate per unit time is the same as the number leaving by the same rate.}
\end{itemize}

\section{Steady State Solution}
For simplicity, we will assume that $g_1=g_2$ such that the B coefficients are the same. 
\begin{align}
    N_1B_{12}\rho(\om_{12}) &= N_2A_{21} + N_2B_{12}\rho(\om_{12}) \\
    N_1 &= N - N_2
\end{align}
Now we can rearrange to eliminate $N_1$.
\begin{align}
    \frac{N_2}{N} &= \frac{B_{12}\rho(\om_{12})}{A_{21}+2B_{12}\rho(\om_{12})}
\end{align}
Now consider the form of the above as the spectral energy density tends to infinity. 
What we see  is that $N_2 \to \frac{N}{2}$.
This tells us that for at least a two-level atom we cannot get population inversion, which is required for lasers, i.e. steady state inversion impossible.

\section{Number of photons per mode}
$\bar{n}$ can be thought of as the mean number of photons per mode, and $g(\om)\,d\om$ as the mode density. 
\begin{align}
    \rho(\om)\,d\om &= \bar{n} \times g(\om)\,d\om \times \hbar\om
\end{align}
Standard result:
\begin{align}
    g(\om)\,d\om &= \frac{\om^2}{\pi^2c^3}\,d\om \\
    \implies \bar{n} &= \frac{\rho(\om)}{\hbar\om g(\om)} = \frac{\pi^2c^3}{\hbar\om^3}\rho(\om)\\
    \bar{n} = \frac{B_{21}\rho(\om)}{A_{21}} = \frac{\text{rate of stimulated emission}}{\text{rate of spontaneous emission}}
\end{align}
It follows that:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\bar{n}>1$ - stimulated emission dominates $\implies$ LASERS
    \item $\bar{n}<1$ - spontaneous emission dominates $\implies$ classical light source
\end{itemize}
For a black body:
\begin{align}
    \bar{n} &= \frac{1}{\exp\left(\frac{\hbar\om_{12}}{k_BT}\right) -1} = \frac{B_{12}\rho(\om)}{A_{21}}
\end{align}
These rates are equal when
\begin{align}
    \frac{\hbar\om_{12}}{k_BT} &= \ln(2)
\end{align}
For $\lambda=500\,nm$, $T= 41400\,K$. So for most black bodies, stimulated emission is negligible.

\chapter{Linewidths and Lineshapes}
2 types of broadening:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Homogeneous - all atoms in sample affected the same
    \item Inhomogeneous - atoms in sample affected differently
\end{itemize}

\section{Homogeneous Broadening}
Every atom/molecule exhibits this type of broadening to varying magnitudes.\\
\textbf{Radiative (natural) broadening:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Consider some excited state population (\textit{doodle}), $N_2$. $e^{-\Gamma_Ht}$
        Leads to some spread in maximum, \textit{doodle}.
        \begin{equation}
            FWHM = \Gamma_H
        \end{equation}
        This broadening follows from the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: Finite lifetime $\implies$ spread in energy, $\Delta E\Delta t \approx \hbar/2$, then a spread in energy $\implies$ a spread in frequency,
        \begin{equation}
            \Delta E = \hbar\Delta\om \implies \Delta\om = \frac{1}{\tau_2} = A_{21} = \Gamma_H
        \end{equation}
        This is only for a 2 level atom.
    \item Define the normalised lineshape function:
        \begin{align}
            L_H(\om) &= \frac{\frac{\Gamma_H}{2\pi}}{(\om-\om_{12})^2+\frac{\Gamma_H^2}{4}} \\
            \ofnt &L_H(\om)\;d\om = 1
        \end{align}
    \item For multiple decay paths: \textit{doodle of decays from level k to levels l,m,n}.
        For level k
        \begin{align}
            \frac{dN_k}{dt} &= -N_kA_{kl} - N_kA_{km} - N_kA_{kn} \\
            \tau_k &= \frac{1}{\sum A_{ki}} = \frac{1}{\Gamma_H}
        \end{align}
    \item When both levels decay, \textit{doodle}.
        \begin{align}
            \Gamma_2 &= \sum A_{2i} = \frac{1}{\tau_2} \\
            \Gamma_1 &= \sum A_{1i} = \frac{1}{\tau_1} \\
            \Gamma_{21} &= \Gamma_2 + \Gamma_1
        \end{align}
        $\Gamma_{21}$ is the emission linewidth. 
\end{itemize}
\begin{example}[Argon ion laser]
    \textit{doodle the laser transition between $3p^44p,^2D_{5/2}^0 \to ^2P_{3/2} \to 3p^5({}^2P_{1/2}^0,{}^2P_{3/2}^0)$}.\\
    $\lambda = 488\,nm$, $A= 7.8\times10^7\;s^{-1}$, $1:\,73,1\;nm;~ A=4.5\times10^8\;s^{-1}$, $2:\,72.3\;nm;~ A=23\times10^8\;s^{-1}$.\\
    Emission linewidth:
    \begin{align}
        \sum A &= 2.8\times10^9 = (2\pi)450\;MHz
    \end{align}
\end{example}
\textbf{Collisional/pressure broadening:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Collisions between atoms - de-excite the atoms $\to$ reduce excited state lifetime $\to$ broader transition
    \item Depends on pressure - important for gas lasers
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Phonon broadening:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{doodle of standard 1,2 transition for bare atom/ion}. In a crystal, two distinct groups of energy levels packed together, quantised vibrational modes $\implies$ phonons. 
    \item Occurs in solid state lasers, and is temperature tempendent
    \item Dominant broadening at room temperature
\end{itemize}

\section{Inhomogeneous Broadening}
\textbf{Doppler Broadening:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Arises due to motion of atoms - when a moving atom emits, there is a Doppler shift dependent on the component of velocity along the direction of the emitted photon.
        \begin{align}
            \om &= \om_{12}\left(1 \pm \frac{v_z}{c}\right)
        \end{align} 
        $\pm$ for blue/red shift - blue as velocity towards observer, red away. 
    \item Broadening arises due to Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of velocities,
        \begin{align}
            P(v_z)\,dv_z &= \left(\frac{M}{2\pi k_BT}\right)^{1/2} \exp\left(-\frac{Mv_z^2}{2k_BT}\right)\;dv_z
        \end{align}
        Use correspondence between $v_z$ and $\om$ to get
        \begin{align}
            P(\om)\,d\om &= \frac{c}{\om_{12}}\left(\frac{M}{2\pi k_BT}\right)^{1/2}\exp\left[-\frac{Mc^2}{2k_B T}\frac{(\om-\om_{12})^2}{\om_{12}^2}\right]
        \end{align}
    \item \textit{doodle tight peak around $\om_{12}$, a smaller tight peak closer to observer with higher freq, and another smaller tight peak further from observer with smaller freq, with a gaussian overcurve.} This is the Gaussian lineshare summed over all velocity classes. $FWHM = \Delta\om_I$.
    \item For Doppler broadening, 
        \begin{align}
            \Delta\om_I &= \frac{2\om_{12}}{c}\left(\frac{2k_BT}{M}\ln2\right)^{1/2} \\
                        &= 7.16\times10^{-7}\om_{12}\left(\frac{T}{M_A}\right)^{1/2}
        \end{align}
        $\Delta\om_I$ is known as the Doppler width, $M_A$ is using the mass in atomic units instead of kg as used so far for $M$.
\end{itemize}
\begin{example}[Argon ion laser 2]
$M_A = 40$, $\lambda=488\,nm$, Discharge temperature $\approx 1200^\circ C$.
\begin{align}
    \Delta\om_I &= (2\pi) 2.7\,GHz
\end{align}
This is many times larger than the natural broadening. 
\end{example}
\textbf{Amorphous crystal broadening:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Occurs in glass materials
    \item Inhomogeneities are Gaussian (normal), the emission is also Gaussian
\end{itemize}

\chapter{}
\begin{example}
\textit{doodle of cylinder with some gas in, narrowband light beam (arrow) towards it}
If the light beam is resonant with the atoms in the gas, we would expect some interaction. 
But how is the medium excited?
It depends on the broadening. 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Homogeneous broadening: \textit{graph of om vs N1, lorentzian about zero, turn on radiation spike above zero, under lorentzian bracket.}\\
        Turn on radiation within natural linewidth. 
        \textit{om vs N2 graph - tiny dotted lorentzian, and om vs N1 graph - lorentzian around 0, then dotted lorentzian that is reduced}
        All of these distributions will be the same - all atoms are affected equally.  
    \item Inhomogeneous broadening: \textit{Gaussian graph around om12 (om vs N1) with spike above, graph of N2 vs om with tiny dotted gaussian around spike, and om vs N1 where it's a Gaussian with tiny dip in it where spike was}
        Distributions are now very different - atoms are affected differently, and only a subset of the atoms interact.
        For example, with Doppler broadening, only particles with a specific velocity would be excited strongly by the light beam. 
        The width of the N2 Gaussian is determined by natural broadening. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{example}
Reminder:
\begin{align}
    A_{21}N_2 &\equiv \text{rate of spontaneous emission per }m^3 \\
    B_{12}\rho(\om_{12})N_1 &\equiv \text{rate of absorption per }m^3 \\
    B_{21}\rho(\om_{12})N_2 &\equiv \text{rate of stimulated emission per }m^3
\end{align}
\section{Homogeneous broadening}
All atoms are affected the same $\implies$ simply define a new constant:
\begin{align}
    a_{21}(\om) &= A_{21}L_H(\om) & b_{12}(\om) &= B_{12}L_H(\om) & b_{21}(\om) &= B_{21}L_H(\om)
\end{align}
Then if we wanted to know the rate of emission now:
\begin{align}
    a_{21}(\om)\,d\om &= \text{rate of emission in range $\om\to\om+d\om$ per atom} 
\end{align}
We have to multiply by the $d\om$ because $L_H(\om)$ has units $\frac{1}{\om}$.
Integrating recovers the result,
\begin{align}
    \int L_H(\om)\,d\om &= 1
\end{align}
Inhomogeneous broadening is more difficult. 
We want to do this, but we can use the results from homogeneous broadening in certain circumstances, i.e. for narrowband light and $\Gamma_H \ll \Delta\om_I$.

\textit{Draw a very thin square slab with width dz, light beam arrow going in with I(z) and light beam leaving with I(z+dz). Slab has label for area A.}\\
Consider a \unl{weak} narrowband beam of light, frequency $\om$ and bandwidth $d\om$. \\
Assume:
\begin{itemize}
    \item No spontaneous emission
    \item Homogeneous broadening
    \item Steady state
\end{itemize}
Find change in power of beam.
\begin{align}
    \left(I(z+dz) - I(z)\right)A &= \left[N_2B_{21}L_H(\om)\rho(\om_{12})\,d\om - N_1B_{12}L_H(\om)\rho(\om_{12})\,d\om\right]\times\hbar\om\times A\,dz
\end{align}
The term inside the square brackets above is the net rate of photons added to the field ($m^{-3}$).\\
For a beam, the intensity is described as
\begin{align}
    I(z) &= c\rho(\om)\;d\om 
\end{align}
Substitute this into Eq (4.7) and rearrange, also using the expressions for A and B coefficients found in lecture 2: 
\begin{align}
    \frac{1}{I}\frac{dI}{dz} &= \frac{\hbar\om}{c}L_H(\om)\left[N_2B_{21} - N_1B_{12}\right] \\
                             &= \frac{\pi^2c^2}{\om^2_{12}}A_{21}L_H(\om)\left[N_2 - \frac{g_2}{g_1}N_1\right]
\end{align}
This uses the assumption that we are close to resonance.\\
The prefactor can be defined as the optical gain cross section,
\begin{align}
    \sigma(\om) &= \frac{\pi^2c^2}{\om_{12}^2}A_{21}L_H(\om).
\end{align}
Solve equation:
\begin{align}
    I(z) &= I(0)\exp\left[\sigma(\om)\times\left(N_2-\frac{g_2}{g_1}N_1\right)z\right]
\end{align}
There are two cases:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Absorption:
        \begin{align}
            N_2 &< \frac{g_2}{g_1}N_1 \\
            \implies I(z) &= I(0)e^{-\kappa(\om)z},~ \kappa(\om) = \sigma(\om)\left(\frac{g_2}{g_1}N_1 - N_2\right)  
        \end{align}
        $\kappa$ is the absorption coefficient. 
        \textit{Draw diagram of Beer's law, decay of I(z) from I(0) as z increases.}
    \item Amplification.
        \begin{align}
            N_2 &> \frac{g_2}{g_1}N_1 \\
            I(z) &= I(0)e^{g(\om)z},~ g(\om) = \sigma(\om)\left(N_2-\frac{g_2}{g_1}N_1\right)
        \end{align}
        $g(\om)$ is the gain coefficient, $e^{g(\om)z}$ is the gain. 
        \textit{Doodle of exponential growth from I(0) with z of I(z).}
\end{enumerate}
The condition for gain is
\begin{equation}
    N_2 > \frac{g_2}{g_1}N_1.
\end{equation}
This is known as \unl{Population Inversion.}
Frequency dependence of the gain:
\begin{align}
    g(\om) &= \sigma(\om)\times N^*, ~ N^* = N_2 - \frac{g_2}{g_1}N_1 \\
           &= \frac{\pi^2c^2}{\om_{12}^2}A_{21}L_H(\om)\times \left[N_2-\frac{g_2}{g_1}N_1\right]
\end{align}
We call $N^*$ the population inversion density. 
\textbf{Note:} Frequency dependence is in the optical gain cross section via $L(\om)$. 
$\sigma(\om)$ is determined by the atom, we cannot control it. 
Broadening spreads gain over a range of frequencies.
